# Relax Project COMP 3005

Created by Tadg O'Hare
This DBMS reads and writes to csv files (tables) and does various relational algebra queries on them

## Instructions

1. Get a CSV file to do operations on
2. Run the code and use help for a list of commands
3. After doing any necessary operations, remember to save your new table(s)

Note that this repository is archived as it was a previously completed class bonus project that I did to learn relational algebra in a more hands on way
